Now I'm also contributing :)



## ANZO'S CODE:
### Part 1 - Documentation:
#### Purpose:
The whole idea is to make a website that allows teachers to create quizes for students. This piece of software also allows teachers to create and administer the students logins
The code is written primarely in PhP, with help from a HTML + CSS combo, and JavaScript for the animations and other client side systems

To run the code, a PhP compatible server has to be setup running at least PhP 7.1 - a good local server can be found at [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/)
The project is also live at [RosenoernProductions test site](https://testing.rosenoern-productions.dk)
